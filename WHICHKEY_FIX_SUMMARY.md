# Which-Key Fix Summary

## Problem
After updating which-key to the new configuration format, the leader key shortcuts stopped working and the which-key menu wasn't appearing when pressing space.

## Solution Applied

1. **Reverted to working configuration format**: Kept the older but functional which-key setup options (with `window`, `triggers`, etc.) instead of the new format that was breaking functionality.

2. **Added explicit leader key mappings**: Enhanced the which-key configuration to explicitly register all leader mappings with proper descriptions and groupings.

3. **Fixed registration structure**: Used the proper `{ prefix = "<leader>" }` option to ensure mappings are correctly associated with the leader key.

4. **Added Telescope mappings**: Included the Telescope finder mappings that were defined in telescope.lua but not visible in which-key.

## Current Status

- Which-key is loaded and configured
- Leader key is set to space (verified)
- All leader mappings are registered with descriptions
- The deprecated warnings in health check are expected and don't affect functionality

## Files Modified

1. `/lua/plugins/which-key.lua` - Main configuration with:
   - BONSAI color scheme applied
   - Comprehensive leader key mappings
   - Proper registration with prefix option
   - Visual mode leader mappings

2. Test scripts created:
   - `test_whichkey.sh` - Enhanced testing script
   - `test_interactive.sh` - Interactive testing guide
   - `WHICHKEY_TEST_GUIDE.md` - User testing instructions

## Next Steps

The user should now test the which-key functionality by:
1. Opening Neovim
2. Pressing space and waiting ~500ms  
3. Verifying the which-key menu appears with all mapped commands

The configuration uses the older but stable format to ensure compatibility. The deprecation warnings can be safely ignored as they don't impact functionality.
