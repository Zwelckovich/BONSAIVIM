# Which-key Fix Summary

## What was fixed:

1. **Updated deprecated which-key configuration**:
   - Changed `window` → `win`
   - Removed `ignore_missing` and `triggers_blacklist`
   - Updated to new `wk.add()` spec format

2. **Fixed duplicate mapping issue**:
   - Removed duplicate mapping definitions from which-key
   - Which-key now only registers groups and descriptions
   - Actual mappings are defined in their respective plugin files

3. **Simplified configuration**:
   - Removed complex triggers and defer functions
   - Using minimal config that relies on which-key defaults
   - Should automatically show menu after 500ms when pressing leader

## How to test:

1. Open Neovim:
   ```bash
   nvim -u config/.config/nvim/init.lua
   ```

2. Test leader key mappings work:
   - `<Space>e` → Opens file explorer
   - `<Space>ff` → Opens Telescope find files
   - `<Space>fg` → Opens Telescope live grep

3. Test which-key menu:
   - Press `<Space>` and wait 500ms
   - Should see which-key menu with all groups

4. Test specific groups:
   - `<Space>f` → Should show find submenu
   - `<Space>w` → Should show window submenu

## Current configuration:

- Leader key: Space
- Timeout: 500ms (defined in init function)
- Which-key uses minimal config with rounded borders
- Groups are registered but mappings come from other plugins
