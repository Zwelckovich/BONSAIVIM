# Pre-commit Validation Assessment

## Collaboration Indicators

### Repository Analysis
- **4+ core files**: ✅ YES (22 Lua config files)
- **Multiple contributors**: ❓ UNKNOWN (git command timed out)
- **Production deployment**: ❌ NO (personal Neovim config)
- **Complex formatting rules**: ✅ YES (Lua syntax requirements)
- **Security-sensitive code**: ❌ NO

### Pre-commit Triggers Met: 2/5

## Decision: SKIP Pre-commit Installation

### Reasoning
While the project meets the file count and formatting complexity triggers, this appears to be a personal Neovim configuration rather than a collaborative project. Pre-commit would add unnecessary overhead for a single-user configuration.

### Alternative Quality Measures
1. **Manual linting**: Run `./tests/lint_phase9_files.sh` before commits
2. **Test suite**: Run `./tests/run_all_tests.sh` to verify configuration
3. **Neovim built-in checks**: `:checkhealth` command

### If Pre-commit is Needed Later
If the project grows to include multiple contributors, pre-commit can be added with:

```bash
# Install pre-commit (not done in this session)
pip install pre-commit

# Create .pre-commit-config.yaml
cat > .pre-commit-config.yaml << 'EOF'
repos:
  - repo: https://github.com/pre-commit/pre-commit-hooks
    rev: v4.5.0
    hooks:
      - id: trailing-whitespace
      - id: end-of-file-fixer
      - id: check-yaml
      - id: check-added-large-files
EOF

# Install hooks
pre-commit install
```

## Status: N/A - Skipped as not required for single-user config
